# Project 10: Automated entity linkages for enhanced data discovery

## Description

The aim in to expand the capabilities of the HDR Gateway by automating the discovery and creation of relationships between entities. This will enable researchers to more effectively explore and connect related data from various sources, facilitating deeper insights and discoveries within the context of the HDR UK and Elixir technology ecosystem.

This project will focus on developing a new "relationship" microservice within the HDR Gateway architecture. This microservice will:

1. NLP-Based Similarity Assessment: Utilise natural language processing techniques to analyse and compare datasets based on specific criteria, such as keywords, topics, or metadata.
2. External Source Integration: Integrate with external sources like BioTools (an Elixir project), EuropePMC, PubMed, EMBL-EBI EGA, and others to identify potential relationships between entities.
3. Relationship Creation: Create new "relationship" linkages within the HDR Gateway database, connecting entities together based on the discovered relationships.
4. Relationship Vetting: Provide a mechanism for data owners to review and validate proposed relationships, ensuring accuracy and quality.
