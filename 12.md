# Project 12: Adopting RO-Crate for enhanced metadata management and visualisation

## Description

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) securely manage sensitive health data whilst supporting research activities. TRE managers play an important role in overseeing (i) data approval, (ii) authorisation, and (iii) disclosure control. However, these processes can be complex and opaque and can hinder efficient decision-making and oversight. Further, HDR UKâ€™s Health Data Research Gateway portal assists researchers in discovering health datasets across the UK, along with associated resources such as tools, research projects, and publications. The portal facilitates a large collection of health datasets and their usage patterns, with a growing list of related tools and courses. Users can filter these resources by subdomain, area, and other criteria.

Both TREs and the Gateway handle, generate and facilitate complex metadata. These platforms face challenges in metadata interpretation, interoperability, and compliance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. In the context of TREs, there is a need for tooling that can present this information in a more accessible and intuitive format to enhance the ability of TRE managers to streamline approval processes and improve oversight. In the context of the Health Data Research Gateway, the metadata and data usage records could be enhanced by adopting RO- Crate as a standard for packaging and describing the research data and associated records. Therefore, this project aims to develop more standardised metadata tooling and knowledge graphs for both TREs and the Gateway. For TREs, we aim to provide clearer insights into the data and workflows encapsulated within RO-Crates. This tooling could help TRE managers by offering visual representations of:
1. Workflow steps and their status within the TRE.
2. Usage patterns.
3. Compliance with the Five Safes framework.
4. Historical TRE activity.

Further, this project aims to enhance interoperability by facilitating easier data integration from the Gateway into other platforms and workflows that support RO-Crates, promote reusability using knowledge graph technologies, and significantly improve compliance with FAIR data principles by exploring mapping of HDR Gateway fields to schema.org fields for RO-Crate, identifying existing and new FAIR vocabulary for data usage registrations as used in Gateway metadata, developing a preliminary converter from Gateway JSON to RO-Crate using above mappings and prototyping an RO-Crate export function that allows users to export metadata of selected entries from a Gateway entry or search.

Sources and types of data:

The TRE component of this project will utilise mock or synthetic metadata. No sensitive or access-controlled data will be used. The Gateway component will use the existing Health Data Research Gateway public entries, possibly using sandbox instances.
