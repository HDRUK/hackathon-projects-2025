# Project 1: FedLlettuce - Federated Learning for Secure LLM Deployment of OMOP Mappings

## Description

One of the most critical requirements for doing federated analytics is to ensure data in contributor sites has a consistent data model. This project aims to develop a POC of federating Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert data in federated sites into the OMOP standard, integrated with a platform for federated querying of the resulting data. 

Team members from U Nottingham have already developed a suitable LLM-based system, Llettuce (https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/lettuce), which is a standalone, open-source, adaptable natural language processing tool for the conversion of medical terms into the OMOP standard vocabulary. It surpasses the performance of existing string-matching tools and is comparable to proprietary models from OpenAI, with the advantage of being open-source, reproducible and privacy preserving. Team members from Bitfount have developed a federated analytics platform which can already run LLMs (https://www.bitfount.com). This project will bring the two existing frameworks together to achieve the aim of federated analytics on unstructured medical data. 

Our key research questions relate to performance, scalability, potential biases in OMOP codification and reproducibility of OMOP codifications within federations. We will test our approach on two datasets involving self-reported anonymised data on medication and a dataset from covid samples. The project has the potential of resulting in a publication where we will discuss our findings.

The project aligns with the FedA project goals from HDR, where we want to assess safety and reliability of federated learning and analysis that could be deployed in Healthcare sites.
