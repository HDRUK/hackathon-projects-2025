# Project 2: Identifying challenges and possible solutions for data management and FAIRification of qualitative health data

## Description

Qualitative data is essential to inform decisions in social and health care systems. This data focuses on participant experiences, and perceptions of different interventions. Moreover, it provides insights into “hows” and “whys” of different participant experience and behaviours, helping healthcare professionals understand the challenges and impact of different interventions (1).

Effective re-use of qualitative data in secondary data analysis and meta-analysis is important for more comprehensive understanding of recurring themes, generalizing results across multiple systems and helping in evidence-based decision making (2, 3).

Despite this (and unlike quantitative data), qualitative data secondary analysis is not common. Qualitative health data presents challenges for its reuse due to concerns about participants’ privacy and the nature of the data (3). This is a result of its narrative methodology, which can expose confidential information - especially in vulnerable populations. However, deidentification of data can remove context that is essential for its reuse - leading to decreased data quality and trustworthiness (3, 4).

Moreover, current data management plan approaches are not designed for some qualitative research designs e.g., ethnography (3, 4). Furthermore, current data repository structures are not suitable for qualitative data because there are no knowledge models and vocabularies that can be adopted without affecting the quality of the data. All of this contributes to the difficulty of adopting FAIR principles to qualitative health data (4).

In this project, we aim to start efforts to address challenges for qualitative data management, by tailoring it to different approaches of this form of data, particularly with relation to FAIRification of qualitative health data. Our project will continue after the hackathon with establishment of a working group focussed on this area.

This project fits into the ELIXIR and HDR mission of accelerating big data use by make it possible for researchers to find and access high quality data. Through this project, we will identify challenges to FAIRification of the qualitative health data and continue efforts by developing tools and frameworks for qualitative health data management - adopting FAIR principles into research practise.

Project objectives:
1. Identify current challenges pertaining to data management of different types of qualitative health data, including FAIRification and deidentification
2. Search and collate existing guidelines and frameworks which could support qualitative data management.
3. Prototype data standard to support qualitative data standards taking into account 1 and 2

Expected outcomes:
1. Whitepaper that presents our discussion which will help engage more researchers in addressing the challenges
2. A GitHub repository for our project where participants can add resources in, and it will be available to everyone after the hackathon
3. Proof-of-concept developments for qualitative data standard and tooling
4. Start discussions of possible solutions/tools to develop to fill in the gap in existing framework and initiatives (continued after the hackathon)


The project does not require any coding experience. It is open to anyone who is interested in qualitative health data research including healthcare professionals, FAIR enthusiasts, and data stewards.
