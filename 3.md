# Project 3: Linking health and environment data

## Description

The challenges of linking health data with other types of data are well-known. Due to privacy concerns, health data are generally de-identified and stored in trusted research environments (also known as data safe havens). Linking health data with other sources, however, is also crucial for understanding the effects of non-health variables on health. Examples of this include:

* social care data - good quality care (or lack thereof) will affect an individual’s health
* environment data - poorly handled heat or cold will affect health, as will spreading pathogens, e.g. as mosquitoes migrate due to climate change).
* and mobility data - for example, when humans mingling contributes to spread of an infectious disease.

As such, we propose co-designing mechanisms that would allow safe linkages between health data and other data types, in ways that do not seriously result in heightened risk of re-identification of de-identified data.

For the scope of the hackathon, we would focus on a scoping exercise: designing a metadata standard that would allow effective linkages between health and environment data. As far as we are aware, there are no good health-and-environment data standards that link both data types effectively and handle the temporal (changing over time) nature of both data types.

We anticipate that the people at the hackathon will be able to offer initial “user testing” of the early schema designs, recognising real-world limitations, and identifying pathways forwards. If an initial prototype schema is not practical by the end of the hackathon, we will instead ensure we provide a report summarising the considerations and challenges that have gone into the work over the two days.

Pre-hackathon preparation: Interview 3-4 individuals about their wishlist for safe linked data.

How the project aligns with the mission and technical priorities of HDR UK and/or ELIXIR-UK:

The project aims to make data more useful to researchers of different fields. The need for interdisciplinary use of health data, or its use with data from other fields is proving necessary to enable discoveries that improve people’s lives, which is the main goal of HDR UK.

Details on the sources and types of data that will be used, if data are required:

* Environment data (for the sake of having an example use-case, we will focus on map data covering the town of Bolton, but we will design a schema intended for any location)
  * Bolton map data from OpenStreetMap
  * Temperature data from Bolton region from UKMet offices
* De-identified patient data from TREs like NHS Digital TRE, or OpenSAFELY. We would not need access to the data directly. Instead, metadata schemas would be sufficient to design and test a cross-data-source metadata schema.
